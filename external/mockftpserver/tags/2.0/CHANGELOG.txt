Changes in version 2.0-rc1 (23 Nov 2008)
------------------------------------------
NEW FakeFtpServer.
  This is an alternative "mock" FTP server implementation. FakeFtpServer provides a higher-level abstraction
  than StubFtpServer. You define a virtual file system, including directories and files, as well as a set of
  valid user accounts and credentials. The FakeFtpServer then responds with appropriate replies and reply
  codes based on that configuration. See online documentation for more information.
StubFtpServer
- StubFtpServer: Refactored to inherit from common AbstractFtpServer superclass.
- Change default org.mockftpserver.stub.command.CdupCommandHandler CDUP reply code from 250 to 200.
- Rename ReplyCodes.SEND_DATA_INITIAL_OK and SEND_DATA_FINAL_OK to TRANSFER_DATA_.. indicate bi-directionality.
- Rename Command.getRequiredString(int) to getRequiredParameter(int).
- Change StubFtpServer CommandHandlers to reply with 501 if required command parameters are missing. Changed AbstractCommandHandler and AbstractCommandHandlerTest.
- Refactor (Stub)PortCommandHandler - pull out common logic into PortParser util class.

Changes in version 1.2 (29 Feb 2008)
