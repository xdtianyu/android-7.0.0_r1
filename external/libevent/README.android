To uprev this project, you'll likely need to reverse engineer the autotools
generated makefiles again.  This is the recipe I used:

BRANCH_ROOT=/usr/local/google/home/wiley/mnc-dev
PATH="${BRANCH_ROOT}/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.8/bin:${PATH}"
NDK_ROOT="${BRANCH_ROOT}/prebuilts/ndk/current/platforms/android-21/arch-arm64/usr"

./configure --host=arm --build=`./config.guess` \
  CC=arm-eabi-gcc \
  CPPFLAGS="-I${NDK_ROOT}/usr/include" \
  CFLAGS="-nostdlib
          -Wl,-rpath-link=${BRANCH_ROOT}/out/target/product/hammerhead/obj/lib
          -L${BRANCH_ROOT}/out/target/product/hammerhead/obj/lib
          -I${BRANCH_ROOT}/prebuilts/ndk/current/platforms/android-21/arch-arm/usr/include" \
  LIBS="-lc "

Note that I built hammerhead first and used prebuilts from the most recent NDK.
