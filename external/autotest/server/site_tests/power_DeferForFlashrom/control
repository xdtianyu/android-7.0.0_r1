This test verifies that flashrom creates a lockfile while performing
potentially-destructive write operations and that powerd defers suspend or
reboot requests while the lockfile exists.

It fails if:
1. powerd suspends or reboots the system while flashrom is running instead of
   waiting until it's exited.
2. After flashrom exits, powerd fails to honor pending suspend or reboot
   requests.
3. The system fails to resume or come back up after rebooting.
