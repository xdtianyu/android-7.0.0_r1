Verify that the device's Bluetooth adapter has the correct default state when
reset to powered off, powered on, and powered back off again.

This is a useful sanity check to ensure that the device state is what we
expect, and that the device state returns to the initial state after a power
cycle.

This is also a security check that our devices are not discoverable unless we
specifically set them to be.
