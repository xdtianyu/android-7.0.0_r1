This test verifies that before we finish association and DHCP negotiations,
WiFi bitrates remain low.  Lower bitrates trade speed for resiliency.  In
noisy or marginal RF environments, this allows us to finish the time dependent
negotiations that establish connectivity without the risk of packet loss.  We
have seen environments where a dropped DHCP or 4 way WPA handshake packet
can cause association to time out.
