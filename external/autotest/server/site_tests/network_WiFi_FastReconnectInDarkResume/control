DOC = """
This test verifies that, during suspend, when a DUT is momentarily disconnected
from an AP that is still up, the DUT will reconnect to that AP during the same
dark resume that was triggered by the disconnect.

We verify the connectivity status of the DUT on resume by parsing shill logs,
since the delays involved in waking a DUT from suspend using autotest framework
make real-time checks inaccurate.
