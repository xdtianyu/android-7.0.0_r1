The test specifically exercises all the state transitions from control.nousb,
plus these additional transitions:
  normal mode -> off
  off -> normal mode boot with USB stick plugged in
  normal mode -> off
  off -> recovery mode boot from USB
  recovery mode -> off
  off -> normal mode

Note also that this test requires a USB stick with a test image be plugged in to
the servo's usbkey port.
