This test checks the behavior of reboot after update. It specifically tests
the amount of time it takes for a system to reboot both after an update and
after first login.

Arg:
  job_repo_url: repo url to use to find image to update from -- assumes caller
                has staged image. By default if host[repo_job_url] is set, it'll
                use that. This overrides that value. This value must follow
                the package_url_pattern in the global config.

To run locally:
  1) Setup your devserver in your shadow config that your DUT can reach.
  2) Stage the image you want for example:
     http://localhost:8080/download?archive_url=\
     gs://chromeos-image-archive/x86-alex/R29-4165.0.0
  3) Run with test_that etc passing
     args="job_repo_url=http://<your_hostname>:8080/static/\
     x86-alex/R29-4165.0.0/autotest/packages"
