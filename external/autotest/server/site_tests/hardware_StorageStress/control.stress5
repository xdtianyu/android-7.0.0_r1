Variants of the test are run to simulate a number of scenarios while execising
device storage.

run_hardware_storage_stress_suspend:
This test calls hardware_StorageFio to write data once and repeatedly verifies
data in the storage for 20 minutes with machine suspended 1 minute between
each verify.

run_hardware_storage_stress:
This test calls hardware_StorageFio to write data once and repeatedly verifies
data in the storage for 5 minutes.

While the test is running, we can corrupt the SSD and check the test is
finding it with:

 dd if=/dev/zero of=<tested partition> bs=512k

run_hardware_storage_reboot:
This test calls hardware_StorageFio to write data once and repeatedly verifies
data in the storage for 5 minutes with machine rebooted between each verify.
