This test ensures that the AP will ask the EC to recompute the hash if
the current hash isn't the right size/offset. Use 'ectool echash' command
to request the hash of some other part of EC EEPROM, then warm-reboot
the AP and use 'ectool echash' to see what hash the EC has after booting.
AP-RW should have requested the EC recompute the hash of EC-RW.
