CRITERIA = """
Prerequirement is as follow:
1. This test should run in normal mode.
2. Fwid should match shellball's (/usr/sbin/chromeos-firmwareupdate) fwid,
   unless this test use a given shellball.
3. A USB disk should be plugged-in, which contains a Chrome OS test image.

This test will fail if one of the following conditions is met:
1. Firmware update fails.
2. After firmware update, device restart with firmware A.
3. Firmware version does not increase after firmware update.
4. Firmware version does not recover to original version after recovery.

This test requires a USB test image plugged in. The firmware id
the current running firmware must matches the system shellball's, or user
can provide a shellball to do this test. In this way, the client will be
update with the given shellball first. On runtime, this test modifies the
