DOC = """
This test verifies that the DUT that suspends connected, then subsequently
disconnects while suspended, successfully reconnects to a preferred network
that later appears while it is still suspended. In this test, the preferred
network that appears during suspend is different from the network that the DUT
was last connected to before suspend.

The test is conducted as follows:

1) AP ("AP 1") is brought up, and DUT connects to it
2) AP 1 is brought down, disconnecting the DUT from it
3) Another AP ("AP 2") is brought up, and DUT connects to it
4) DUT suspends while connected to AP 2
5) AP 2 is brought down, disconnecting the DUT from it while suspended
6) AP 1 is brought up again
7) The DUT is woken from suspend
8) Verify that the DUT is connected to AP 1 upon resuming from suspend

We verify the connectivity status of the DUT on resume by parsing shill logs,
since the delays involved in waking a DUT from suspend using autotest framework
make real-time checks inaccurate.
