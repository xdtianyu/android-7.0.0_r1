This test verifies that the DUT successfully reconnects to a network in dark
resume after getting disconnected from that same network while suspended.
This test simulates the cases where multiple disconnect and SSID appearance
events take place over a single period of suspension. The test is conducted as
follows:

1) AP ("AP 1") is brought up, and DUT connects to it
2) AP 1 is brought down, disconnecting the DUT from it
3) Another AP ("AP 2") is brought up, and DUT connects to it
4) DUT suspends while connected to AP 2
5) AP 2 is brought down, disconnecting the DUT from it while suspended
6) AP 2 is brought up again
7) Repeat steps 5-6 another 4 times (for 5 total iterations)
8) The DUT is woken from suspend
9) Verify that the DUT is connected to AP 2 upon resuming from suspend

We verify the connectivity status of the DUT on resume by parsing shill logs,
since the delays involved in waking a DUT from suspend using autotest framework
make real-time checks inaccurate.

Note: this test suspends the DUT for long periods of time, which may lead to
flakiness if the ssh connection from the autotest host to the DUT has a
ServerAliveInterval setting that is too low (i.e. less than the total suspend
time). This test was verified stable with the ServerAliveInterval set to 900.
