This test installs a specified test image onto a servo-connected DUT.
The principle purpose is to allow installing a known-good image onto
a wedged unit that would otherwise have to be re-imaged manually.

Here is the command to install a recovery image with a locally attached
servo:
    test_that -b ${BOARD} ${IP_ADDRESS} \
        --args="image=$IMAGE_PATH" platform_InstallTestImage
