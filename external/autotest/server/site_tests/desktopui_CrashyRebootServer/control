This test verifies that the logic we put in place to reboot the device in the
face of a too-crashy UI functions as intended:

If the UI crashes too much too fast, the device will eventually reboot
to attempt to mitigate the problem. If the device determines that it's
already tried that some number of times, it will shut down the UI and
remain up.

This test deploys the client test desktop_CrashyReboot in order to drive the
device into the desired states.
