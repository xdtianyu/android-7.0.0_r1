This test uses servo to connect/disconnect servo USB hub before and
after events like reboot, login, suspend, resume etc.

The test fails if
- crash files are generated
- device is pingable when suspended
- wrong action passed through action_sequence flag
- USB detected peripherals are different than expected
- there is no servo board attached
