DOC = """This test runs a series of different tasks like media playback, flash
animation, large file download etc. It measures and reports power
consumptions during each of those tasks.

Args:
    short: Boolean, if True, run a shorter version of the test with fewer
        measurements. Designed to run in under 5 minutes so it can be used in
        the per-build test suite.
    test_groups: list of sub-test groups to run. Those refer to _run_group_X()
        methods. None - to use defaults hard-coded in the test.
    reps: a multiplier used for running longer tests. With reps=N each sub-test
        will run roughly N times longer. This is good for averaging out more
        of the noise and therefore getting better accuracy.
    ac_ok: Boolean, if True, allowed to run with power supply attached.
