  Tests that we can complete L2TP/IPSec PSK VPN authentication.
  This is a client-only test which verifies function of the L2TP/IPSec
  client.  Since the server it is testing against is itself, this test
  is best suited for verifying that the connection manager and VPN
  manager are correctly passing parameters to the underlying VPN client
  to have it properly connect.

  This test fails if the DUT cannot authenticate to a locally running
  L2TP/IPSec PSK VPN server runing at the other end of a virtual Ethernet
  interface.
