System stress test is an open source stress tool that works by stressing
system interfaces. It is good at catching memory signal integrity issues or
setup/hold problems, memory controller and bus interface issues, and disk
controller issues. It can also detect bad memory cells and cache coherency
issues.

Large amounts of memory is allocted in a single block, and memory is divided
into chunks, each filled with a potentially stressful data pattern. Worker
threads are spawned which draw pages from an empty queue and a valid queue, and
copy data to the other.
