  Tests that 3G modem can connect to the network

  The test attempts to connect using an E362 wardmodem. The test then
  disconnects from the network, and verifies that the modem still
  responds to modem manager DBUS API calls.  It repeats the
  connect/disconnect sequence several times.
  Since this test uses the wardmodem, it has no hardware dependencies.
