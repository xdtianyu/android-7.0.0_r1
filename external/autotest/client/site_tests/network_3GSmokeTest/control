  Tests that 3G modem can connect to the network

  The test attempts to connect using the 3G network.  It assumes that
  a 3G modem is plugged in and has a signal.  The test then
  disconnects from the network, and verifies that the modem still
  responds to modem manager DBUS API calls.  It repeats the
  connect/disconnect sequence several times.
