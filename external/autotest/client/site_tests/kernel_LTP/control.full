The Linux Test Project is a suite of tests. The suite is executed through a
shell program. Most of the tests are written in C, with some in bash and Perl,
and are designed to test various aspects of the Linux operating system. Most
test cases will use a glibc interface if it exists, or kernel header files if
available.
