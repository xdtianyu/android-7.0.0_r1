This test runs a load test consisting of cycling though web pages, playing
videos, etc. and measures battery power draw. The duration of this test is
determined by the loop_time * loop_count variables below.

This control file is simply meant to stimulate the various aspects of the test
to validate mechanics are in good health (login, external website access).

It ignores whether wired access (check_network=False) or AC is
connected(ac_ok=True).

For reasons above and reduced runtime (3min) it will NOT produce valid power
consumption results for the 60/20/10/10 load and therefore should NOT be used
for any battery life estimations.
