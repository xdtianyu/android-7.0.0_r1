# Args:
# type: [window, cycle] Window will open a window with tabs for the duration of

# tabs: list of urls for the window type
# urls: list of urls to cycle through for the cycle type

# The duration and delay are scaled by 1/12 due to the loop time being 300
# instead of 3600 seconds. This is why duration is minutes(60) instead of
# minutes(5) and delay is minutes(12) instead of minutes(1).
