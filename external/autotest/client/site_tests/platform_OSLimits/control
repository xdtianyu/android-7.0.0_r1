Verifies various system level limits and settings.

The resources being verified are:
  - Max open files: the maximum number of file descriptors a process can open.
  - Max processes: the maximum number of processes that can be created for
    the real user id of the calling process.

The sysctls being verified are:
  - fs/file-max: maximum number of file handles that the kernel will allocate.
    The default value is usually about 10% of RAM in kilobytes.
  - fs/leases-enable:
    - 0: no leases on files allowed.
    - 1: leases are allowed to be established on a file.
  - fs/nr_open: the maximum number of file handles a process can allocate.
    file-max cannot exceed this value.
  - kernel/kptr_restrict: do not expose kernel addresses to userspace.
  - kernel/ngroups_max: the number a groups a user may belong to.
  - kernel/panic: number of seconds the kernel postpones rebooting when the
    system experiences a kernel panic. 0 disables automatic rebooting.
  - kernel/pid_max: the maximum value of a pid before it wraps.
  - kernel/randomize_va_space:
    - 0: no ASLR for userspace processes.
    - 1: ASLR for stack and mmap (and exec if built PIE).
    - 2: same as above except also randomize brk location.
  - kernel/suid_dumpable:
    - 0: core dump not produced for a process with changed cred.
    - 1: all processes core dump when possible.
    - 2: binary which is not normally dumped is dumped ro by root.
  - kernel/sysrq: Activates the System Request Key when anything other than 0.
  - kernel/threads-max: Maximum threads on system.
  - net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies: make sure weird inbound TCP flooding is safe.
  - vm/mmap_min_addr: make sure low memory cannot be allocated.
