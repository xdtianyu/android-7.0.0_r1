    This test will run the firmware request kernel self test (from upstream).
    This tests that the request_firmware() and request_firmware_nowait() kernel
    APIs are somewhat sane. It tries to load the empty filename ("") as well as
    a small toy firmware, and checks that it matches. It also makes sure a
    non-existent firmware cannot be found.

    We rerun the same test several times to increase the probability of
    catching errors.

    Of course, a success doesn't mean the absence of race conditions or bugs.
    We may have just won the race.
