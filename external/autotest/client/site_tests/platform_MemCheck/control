Verifies that memory levels look sane.

The resources being verified are:

Total Memory
Free Memory
Swap Total
Virtual Memory Total
Memory Speed

We are assuming that we should have at least 1/2 of total memory free and
that virtual memory should be at least 102400 KB and memory speed is at
least 1333 MHz.

This test requires a reboot of the DUT before it runs for free memory check
(thus the 'cleanup-reboot' dependency).
