  Tests that we can validate a ChromeCast device by its certificate.  This test
  fails if crypto-util is unable to verify a valid ChromeCast device
  certificate or validates an invalid certificate.  This checks the ways that
  crypto-util interacts with OpenSSL and verifies that we're expecting the
