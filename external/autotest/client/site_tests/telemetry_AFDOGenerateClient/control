Run a pre-defined set of pages for the DUT for Chrome profile collection.

The purpose of this test is to exercise chrome with a meaningful set
of pages while a profile of Chrome is captured. It also aims at using
the minimum set of functionality from Telemetry since Telemetry is not
very stable on ChromeOS at this point.

This test is designed to be called from the telemetry_AFDOGenerate
server test. The server test will start the "perf" profiling tool on
the DUT before starting this test. It will also capture the chrome
profile and upload it to Google Storage to be used for an optimized
build of Chrome.
