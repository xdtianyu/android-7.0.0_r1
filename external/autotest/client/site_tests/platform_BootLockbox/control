This test verifies that boot lockbox mechanism is functional.  It tests that
lockbox data can be signed and verified before finalization but after
finalization it can only be verified.  This test requires a reboot of the DUT
before it runs so that it starts in a not-finalized state (thus the 'cleanup-
reboot' dependency).
