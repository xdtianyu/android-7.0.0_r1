  After an online payment to activate a CDMA network, shill issues an OTASP
  activation command to ModemManager and keeps retrying in the case of failure.
  This test verifies that the activation state exposed by ModemManager is
  reflected correctly in shill and that activation retries are repeatedly
  scheduled in case of failure.
