Test to determine if the kernel's perf event architecture can handle
a process changing its name and still attribute the samples to a binary.

A test program which changes its name using prctl runs under perf and runs
through a computational crc loop in order to ensure it gets some samples.
Perf produces a data file from that run, and that data file is run through
perf again to produce a report.  The report is checked to see that the samples
were not marked "unknown".
