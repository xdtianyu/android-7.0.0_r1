This test verifies that PKCS #11 services remain functional when the TPM is
operating under low-resource conditions. Specifically, more keys are used than
are able to fit in TPM memory which requires that previously loaded keys be
evicted. The test exercises the eviction code path as well as the reload code
path (when a previously evicted key is used again).
