This is the Kernel Per-Build Benchmarks Test suite.  Failures in this test
suite should not close the tree. It should consist of SHORT tests that gather
data for long-term kernel performance evaluation.  It runs on every build so
it should consist of SHORT tests.  Longer running benchmarks should be added
to kernel_daily_benchmarks or kernel_weekly_benchmarks.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
