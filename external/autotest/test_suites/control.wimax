Run automated tests on a DUT with a WiMAX module supported by Chrome OS to
verify the WiMAX support on Chrome OS:
- WiMAX kernel driver is present and loaded when a WiMAX module is detected
- WiMAX firmware is present and loaded onto the WiMAX module
- WiMAX manager is present and running, and is able to perform the expected
  operations on the WiMAX module
- shill is built with WiMAX support and is able to interact with WiMAX manager
  properly over DBus

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
