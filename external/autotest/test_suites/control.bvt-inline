This is the portion of the Build Verification Test suite required
to pass before any other tests may run.  Test failures in this
suite trigger automatic actions:
  * Failures in the Commit Queue or Pre-Flight Queue fail the build,
    and block running tests from the bvt-cq suite.
  * Failures in the canary turn the tree red, block all other tests
    for the build, and generally mean that QA cannot further
    evaluate the build's fitness for release.

Requirements for a test to be in this suite:
 1. The test should be SHORT, and should not require any specialized
    lab resources.
 2. A test failure should indicate one or more of the following
    impacts is possible:
     * The failure may impact the stability of the test lab.
     * The failure may prevent discovery of other bugs.
     * The failure may block ordinary development tasks.
 3. A test failure must reliably indicate a bug in the product, and
    not a bug in the test.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
