# Force a verify job for any host that hasn't seen activity in
# the past day.
#
# Various scripts/cron jobs look for DUTs that aren't working.  To
# be conservative, those scripts assume that a DUT that hasn't run
# any jobs within a reasonable time interval isn't working, since
# some of the ways a DUT may be unavailable manifest as inactivity.
#
# In some cases, we'd like to be more certain as to a DUT's status.
# This script goes through the entire AFE hosts table, and
# identifies unlocked hosts that would otherwise be flagged as "not
# working due to lack of activity", and forces a Verify job.
#
# Locked hosts are skipped because they can't run jobs, and because
# we want them to show up as suspicious anyway.
