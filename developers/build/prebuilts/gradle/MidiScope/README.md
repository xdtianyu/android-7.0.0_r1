Android MidiScope Sample
===================================

Sample demonstrating how to use the MIDI API to receive and process MIDI signals coming from an
attached device.

Introduction
------------

The Android MIDI API ([android.media.midi][1]) allows developers to connect a MIDI device to Android
and process MIDI signals coming from it. This sample demonstrates some basic features of the MIDI
API, such as enumeration of currently available devices (Information includes name, vendor,
capabilities, etc), notification when MIDI devices are plugged in or unplugged, and receiving MIDI
signals. This sample simply shows all the received MIDI signals to the screen log and does not play
any sound for them.
