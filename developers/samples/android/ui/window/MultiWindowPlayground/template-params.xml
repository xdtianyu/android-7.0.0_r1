This sample demonstrates the use of the multi-window API available
in Android N. It shows the use of new Intent flags and
AndroidManifest properties to define the multi-window behavior.
Switch the sample app into multi-window mode to see how it affects
the lifecycle and behavior of the app.

<![CDATA[
Android N introduces new APIs to support multiple activities
to be displayed at the same time.

Activities that are started within the same task stack
inherit their multiwindow properties from the activity that fired
off the intent. The following features are available when an activity
has been launched into a new task stack.

An activity can be set as not resizable through the
`android:resizableActivity` property in the AndroidManifest. All
applications targeting Android N or above are resizable by default.

In split-screen mode, an activity can be started adjacent to the
launching activity by setting the
`Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_TO_ADJACENT` flag in its intent.

Sometimes activities may choose to handle configuration changes
themselves (for example for games or OpenGL-based applications). In this
case, setting
`android:configChanges=screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation`
in the AndroidManifest definition of the activity enables callbacks for
all configuration changes that may occur during multi-window use for the
Activity. See [Handling Runtime Changes][1].

In freeform mode (where applications can be freely resized), activities
can be started within a certain area of the screen using the
`ActivityOptions#setLaunchBounds` call.

Alternatively, the preferred and minimum sizes can be set in a new
`layout` property in the AndroidManifest.
