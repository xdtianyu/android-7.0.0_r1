        <intro>
<![CDATA[
This sample demonstrates how to use the Scoped Directory Access API that provides easy way to
access specific directories instead of:
 - Requesting READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE or WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE in your manifest, which allows
   access to all public directories on external storage.
 - Using the Storage Access Framework, where the user usually picks directories via a System UI,
   which is unnecessary if you app always accesses to the same external directory.

To access to a specific directory, use a new Intent created using the StorageVolume class like
following:

```
StorageManager sm = getSystemService(StorageManager.class);
StorageVolume volume = sm.getPrimaryVolume();
Intent intent = volume.createAccessIntent(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);
startActivityForResult(intent, request_code);
```

Note that the argument passed to StorageVolume.createAccessIntent needs to be one of the
values of Environment.DIRECTORY_\*.

Once the user grants the access, `onActivityResult` override will be called with a
result code of `Activity.RESULT_OK` and an intent data that contains the URI representing
the directory.
