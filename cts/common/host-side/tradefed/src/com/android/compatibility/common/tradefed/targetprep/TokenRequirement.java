 * A token is string that is required by a test module and given to a device by the user, they are
 * used by the scheduler to ensure tests are scheduled on the correct devices. Eg if the user is
 * sharding the innvocation across 10 devices, they will not want to put a SIM card in every device,
 * instead they can use a single SIM card and use tokens to tell the scheduler which device should
 * be used to run the SIM card tests.
