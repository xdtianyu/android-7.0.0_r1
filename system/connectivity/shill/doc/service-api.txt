Interface	org.chromium.flimflam.Service
Object path	[variable prefix]/{service0,service1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Return the properties for the service object. See
			the Properties section for available properties.

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Change the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty
					 [service].Error.InvalidService
					 [service].Error.InvalidPassphrase

		void SetProperties(dict properties)

			Set multiple properties in a Service at once.
			Each property from the dict is applied, excluding
			the "Profile" property and all properties intrinsic
			to the service including "Type" for all services,
			as well as "Mode", "SSID" and "Security" for WiFi
			services.  In the event of multiple errors while
			applying properties to the service, the first error
			code is returned by this call.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty
					 [service].Error.InvalidService
					 [service].Error.InvalidPassphrase

		void ClearProperty(string name)

			Clear the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty

		array{bool} ClearProperties(array{string} names)

			Clear the value of the specified properties.  Calls
			ClearProperty above on each of the property names
			and returns an array of boolean values indicating
			whether each ClearProperty attempt succeeded.

		void Connect()

			Initiate a connection for the specified service.

			For Ethernet devices this method can only be used
			if it has previously been disconnected. Otherwise
			the plugging of a cable automatically triggers
			a connection.  If no cable is plugged in this
			method will fail.

			If the requested service is already connected
			then this request is ignored and AlreadyConnected
			is returned.

			If the requested service is in the process of
			connecting then this request is ignored and
			InProgress is returned.

			If another service of the same type is connected or
			connecting then it is terminated before this request
			is handled.

                        If the requested service cannot, for reasons not
                        described above, be connected, OperationFailed is
                        returned.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.AlreadyConnected
					 [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.OperationAborted
					 [service].Error.InvalidService
					 [service].Error.OperationFailed

		void Disconnect()

			Disconnect a service. If the service is not
			connected or in the process of connecting an
			error message will be generated.

			For Ethernet devices this will remove all
			Layer 3 state and mark the associated network
			interface down.  If no cable is plugged in this
			request will fail.

			This method can also be used to abort a previous
			connection attempt via the Connect method.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
			                 [service].Error.OperationFailed

		void Remove()

			Disconnect and remove the configuration of a
			service.  This disassociates the service from
			its current profile.  If another profile supports
			this service, it will be re-configured there.

			This method is not permitted for Ethernet devices;
			it will generate a NotSupported error response.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotSupported

		void ActivateCellularModem(string carrier)

			Activate a cellular modem on the provided carrier.

			This method returns immediately.  The caller
			can either poll the Cellular.ActivationState
			property, or monitor the PropertyChanged
			signal to know when and if the
			ActivateCellularModem call succeeded.

			The correct carrier specific modem firmware
			must already be loaded before this method is
			called.

			If this method is called for a non-cellular
			service or on a service associated with a
			non-CDMA device, it will return a NotSupported
			error.

			If the device is already activated nothing is returned.
			but if the device needs to be activated an InProgress
			error is returned.

			Expected Result: [service].Error.InProgress
			Possible Errors: [service].Error.NotSupported

		void CompleteCellularActivation()

			Complete the activation of a cellular service that is
			being activated over a non-cellular network.  This
			method is called upon the completion of the online
			payment portal and performs the necessary checks
			to ensure the activation process has fully completed.

			This method returns immediately.  The caller
			can either poll the Cellular.ActivationState
			property, or monitor the PropertyChanged
			signal to know when and if the activation process
			has completed.

			If this method is called on a non-cellular service
			or on a cellular service that is not being activated
			over a non-cellular network, it will return a
			NotSupported error.

			If the cellular service is already activated or being
			activated, nothing is returned.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.NotSupported

		dict GetLoadableProfileEntries()

			Return a dictionary of object_path -> string pairs
			which refer to the profile entries from the loaded
			profiles in the Manager that could possibly provide
			configuration for this service.  Each entry contains
			the DBus path of the profile and the string entry
			name (within that profile) that contains configuration
			for this service.  Callers can use each of these
			argument pairs to do a "GetEntry" call on each profile
			object.

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.


Properties	boolean AutoConnect [readwrite]

			If set to true, this service will auto-connect
			when no other connection is available.  If multiple
			services are marked for auto-connect then the highest
			priority available service will be selected.

			"network_id" The MCC (Mobile Country Code)
				     and MNC (Mobile Network Code) of the
				     operator on whose network the device is
				     registered. The value of the property is
				     the simple concatenation of the MCC and
				     the MNC, with no separator. The first
				     three digits are always the MCC, and
				     the following two or three digits are the
				     MNC.

		string Cellular.NetworkTechnology [readonly]

			(Cellular only) If the modem is registered on a
			network, then this property gives the data bearer
			technology currently in use.  The following
			table lists the values this property may have,
			along with a rough indication of the "generation"
			to which the technology is considered to belong.

			Value          Generation

			the current network. Possible values are "home",
			"roaming", and "unknown".

		string Cellular.Olp [readonly]

			(Cellular only) A dictionary describing the
			online payment portal (OLP) at which a user
			can sign up for, or modify, a mobile data
			plan.  The value of this property is a
			string -> string dictionary, which includes
			the following keys:

			"url"      The URL for the portal
			"method"   The HTTP method to use, "GET" or "POST"
			"postdata" If the method is POST then this key is
				   present and contains the postdata
				   to send.

		dict Cellular.APN [readwrite] [GSM only]

			(Cellular only) The APN to be used with a GSM
			carrier for making data connections. The value of
			this property is a string -> string dictionary,
			which must include at least the following key:

			"apn"  The APN to use for making connections

			There are three optional properties. The first is

			"network_id" The network ID (MCC/MNC pair) of the
			             network for which the APN should be used.
				     If not specified, then the network ID of
				     the currently registered network is used.

			The other two optional properties are "username"
			and "password", which, if specified, will be supplied
			to the connect operation on the modem along with the
			APN.

			When the APN is set using this method, it overrides
			any APN that may be associated with the specified
			network ID in the APN database. The APN setting is
			persistent across reboots.

			A user-specified APN may be cleared by clearing this
			property.

			The algorithm for connecting to GSM networks is as
			follows, stopping when a connection is succesfully
			established:
			1. Try the last APN that resulted in a successful
			   connection.
			2. Try the APN that was set from the Cellular.APN
			   property (if any).
			3. Try the list of APNs for the current provider one
			   at a time. The list comes from the mobile broadband
			   provider information database.
			4. As a last resort, try connecting without specifying
			   an APN.

			If all these steps fail, then the connect attempt fails.
			Whenever this property is set to establish a new APN to
			use, the remembered last-good-APN is cleared. The
			remembered last-good-APN is persistent across reboots.

		dict Cellular.LastGoodAPN [readonly] [GSM only]

			(Cellular only) The APN information used in the
			last successful connection attempt.  If the last
			attempt was unsuccesful, this property is unset.

			should do captive portal checking).

		boolean Connectable [readonly]

			Indicates whether a service is prepared for use
			as an argument to the Connect method.  A service
			will not be marked Connectable if, for example,

			system will not report a hostname.  When this property
			is set it will be persisted in the default profile.

		string DHCPProperty.VendorClass [readwrite]

			Optional setting to configure DHCP requests.  This
			setting can be used to identify the vendor that
			manufactured the client hardware, the software in use,

		string Passphrase [readwrite]

			If the service type is "wifi", then this property
			holds a passphrase used in setting up services of
			type "wep", "wpa", "rsn", "psk", or a private
			key password used in setting up services of
			type "802_1x".

			For "wep" services, this must contain the WEP
			key and, optionally, a key index.  Only 40-bit
			and 104-bit WEP keys are supported.  The WEP
			key can be formatted either as an ASCII string
			(5 or 13 characters), or as ASCII hex digits
			(10 or 26). When using ASCII hex digits, the
			key may optionally be preceded by "0x" or "0X".
			To specify an optional WEP key index, prepend
			the key with "0:", "1:", "2:" or "3:".  If no

			By default this property is not included in get
			requests.  It may be present if a non-default
			security policy is configured and the client has
			"read secret" privileges.

			Note that no PropertyChanged signals are sent for
			this property. The PassphraseRequired property
			should be monitored instead.

		boolean PassphraseRequired [readonly]

			If the service type is "wifi", then this property
			indicates if a passphrase or key (for WEP) is required.

			If a passphrase has been set already or if no
			passphrase is needed, then this property will
			be set to false.

			UI clients may monitor this property for a
			PropertyChanged signals to prompt for a required
			passphrase or key.

			it last failed.

			Possible values:

				Failure - The attempt failed at this phase
				Success - The attempt succeeded at this phase
				Timeout - The attempt timed out at this phase

		string PreviousError [readonly]

			The most recent service error status logged.  Even
			after the service leaves the failed state, this
			property retains the last value that the Error property
			contained.

			Note that no PropertyChanged signals are sent for
			this property. The Error property should be monitored
			instead.

		int32 PreviousErrorSerialNumber [readonly]

			This number increases by one every time a service
			failure is logged.  It returns to zero if shill
			restarts.

			Note that no PropertyChanged signals are sent for
			this property. The Error property should be monitored
			instead.

		int32 Priority [readwrite]

			An optional value used to calculate the priority order
			of this service.  Priorities are between 1 to 100.
			Services with priorities are sorted ahead of services
			without.  Services with the same priority are ordered
			by other means such as service type signal strength
			or technology.

			By default services are not assigned a priority;
			clients must set one if they desire.  To remove an
			existing priority use the ClearProperty method.

		int32 PriorityWithinTechnology [readwrite]

			An optional value used to calculate the priority order
			of this service.  Priorities are between 1 to 100.
			Services with priorities are sorted ahead of services
			without.  Services with the same priority are ordered
			by other means such as service type and signal
			strength, but notably not technology.  This property
			can be used instead of the Priority property when
			the intent is to rank the service relative to other
			services of the same technology.

			By default services are not assigned a priority;
			clients must set one if they desire.  To remove an
			existing priority use the ClearProperty method.

		string Profile [readwrite]

			The object path of the associated Profile object.
			This may not be present or may be empty if the Service
			object has not been written to a profile yet.

		string ProxyConfig [readwrite]

			An externalized json dictionary describing the proxy

                        modified by a user.
			Flimflam does not use this information for anything,
			but it is left available to the caller, and stored
			persistently.
			This property may be set by any client and will be
                        adopted by chrome during run-time.  If syntax of the
                        value is wrong, chrome will ignore this property during
                        runtime.
                        The value of this property is a string -> string
                        dictionary that includes the following keys. The final
                        string is a comma separated list of key-value pairs
                        enclosed by "{" and "}"; syntax of a key-value pair is:
                        <key>":"<value>. Example:

                            value is either true or false (without quotes), e.g.
                            "pac_mandatory":true;
                            if true, network traffic does not fall back to

                            available

			"server"
                            proxy server for manual configuration (meaningful

                            for example:
                            - "http=foopy:80;ftp=foopy2" --
                              use HTTP proxy "foopy:80" for http:// URLs, and
                              HTTP proxy "foopy2:80" for ftp:// URLS
                            - "foopy:80" -- use HTTP proxy "foopy:80" for all
                              URLs
                            - "socks4://foopy" --
                              use SOCKS v4 proxy "foopy:80" for all URLs

			"bypass_list"
                            proxy bypass rules for manual configuration
                            (meaningful only if mode=fixed-servers); format
                            can be any one of the following:
                            1) [<url_scheme>"://"]<hostname_pattern>[":"<port>]
                               Match all hostnames that match the pattern
                               hostname_pattern which can be a substring of the
                               hostname with asterisks.
                               Examples: "foobar.com", "*foobar.com",
                               "*.foobar.com", "*foobar.com:99",
                               "https://x.*.y.com:99"
                            2) "."<hostname_suffix_pattern>[":"<port>]
                               Match a particular domain suffix.
                               Examples: ".google.com", ".com",
                               "http://.google.com"
                            3) [<scheme>"://"]<ip_literal>[":"<port>]
                               Match URLs that are IP address literals.
                               Conceptually this is the similar to (1), but with
                               special cases to handle IP literal
                               canonicalization. For example matching on
                               "[0:0:0::1]" would be the same as matching on
                               "[::1]" since the IPv6 canonicalization is done
                               internally.
                               Examples: "127.0.1", "[0:0::1]", "[::1]",
                               "http://[::1]:99"
                            4) <ip_literal>"/"<prefix_length_in_bits>
                               Match any URL that is to an IP literal that falls
                               in the given range. IP range is specified using
                               CIDR notation.
                               Examples: "192.168.1.1/16", "fefe:13::abc/33".
                            5)  "<local>"
                                Match local addresses; this is a literal string.
                                "<local>" matches one of: "127.0.0.1", "::1",
                                "localhost".

			path supplied in the "IPConfig" property above)
			will display the result of the merged network
			parameters.

			Here are the expected keys within the dict:
				string Address
				string Gateway
				int32 Mtu
				array{string} NameServers
				string PeerAddress
				int32 Prefixlen

		dict SavedIPConfig [readonly]

			This property present a dictionary of the IP config
			that was received from the DHCP server prior to
			applying any static IP parameters during the most
			recent connection attempt. All parameters are saved
			regardless of whether they were overridden.

			Note that if a static IP parameter is set on
			a service, but the service has not been re-connected,
			the IPConfig object will still contain the true
			value that the interface is set to.

			Here are the expected keys within the dict:
				string Address
				string Gateway
				int32 Mtu
				array{string} NameServers
				string PeerAddress
				int32 Prefixlen

		uint8 Strength [readonly]

			Indicates the signal strength of the service. This
			is a normalized value between 0 and 100.

			This property will not be present for Ethernet
			devices.

		string Tethering [readonly]

			Returns a string that indicates an estimate of
			whether the service is likely to be providing
			internet connectivity over a mobile network backhaul.
			The possible values of this string are:

				NotDetected: Tethering is not detected.
				Suspected: Something in the network scan
					provides circumstantial evidence
					that this service is tethered.
				Confirmed: Some definitive evidence has
					been discovered that indicates
					either this service is tethered
					or the server is overtly pretending
					to be tethered.

			This property is only visible in service types
			which can support tethering.  Currently only
			Ethernet and WiFi services support this property
			directly.  VPN services make this property visible
			if the service they're using for connectivity does
			(i.e., if VPN connectivity is gained via Ethernet
			or WiFi).

		string Type [readonly]

			The service type; one of:
			  "ethernet"    (802.3 wired Ethernet),
			  "wifi"        (IEEE 802.11),
			  "wimax"       (IEEE 802.16),
			  "bluetooth"   (Bluetooth PAN),
			  "cellular"    (3G Cellular), or
			  "vpn"         (Virtual Private Network).

			This information should only be used to determine
			advanced properties or showing the correct icon
			to the user.

		string UIData [readwrite]

			This is additional data available about this service
			for use by the user interface.  This value is opaque
			and not used by shill.

		bool Visible [readonly]

			WiMax and WiFi services list all services for which
			configuration exists in the manager's
			ServiceCompleteList.  Those service types have this
			property set to false if such a configured service
			is not actually in range.  For all other services
			(including all other service types) this property
			is always true.

		string WiFi.AuthMode [readonly]

			(WiFi only) If the service state is
			"configuration" or "ready", then this property
			will be present and contains the negotiated
			authentication method.

			There are too many possible values to enumerate here.
			The complete set depends on the capabilities of the
			associated WiFi supplicant.

		string WiFi.BSSID [readonly]

			(WiFi only) The BSSID of the associated AP.
			One can monitor this property for PropertyChanged
			signals to identify when roaming changes the
			current AP.

			The BSSID is formatted as colon-separated octets.
			E.g. "00:01:02:03:04:05".

		boolean WiFi.HiddenSSID [readwrite]

			(WiFi only) If true, the associated WiFi network
			does not broadcast its SSID in beacon frames.
			This property instructs shill to actively scan
			for this SSID.  This value is cleared when this
			service is removed from all active profiles.

		uint16 WiFi.Frequency [readonly]

			(WiFi only) The operating frequency in MHz of
			the Service. If the Service is connected, this
			is the frequency on which it is connected.
			Otherwise, this is the frequency of the best
			available BSS (roughly, AP) for this Service.

		array{uint16} WiFi.FrequencyList [readonly]

			(WiFi only) The operating frequencies in MHz of
			the Service. This lists all of the frequencies
			where this Service has recently been seen.

			This list is not necessarily complete, as:
			a) not all scans check every channel,
			b) an AP may not have responded in time, and
			c) some scan results may have expired from the
                           cache.

		string WiFi.PhyMode [readonly]

			(WiFi only) If the service state is
			"configuration" or "ready", then this property
			will be present and contains the negotiated
			operating mode for the channel.  Possible values
			include "802.11a", "802.11b", "802.11g",
			"802.11n".  This value is for informational
			purposes only.

		string WiFi.HexSSID [readonly]

			(WiFi only) This property holds a hex-encoded copy
			of the SSID.  Since the Name property is enforced
			by the D-Bus protocol to be a valid UTF-8 string
			but SSIDs can be an abitrary sequence of bytes, this
			property will always contain the true value of the
			SSID, while the Name property may differ from the
			true representation.

			See also the Name property. (Note that there is
			no SSID property for reasons explained above.)

		string WiFi.SSID [readonly]

			(WiFi only) The service's SSID. Must have a non-zero
			length less than or equal to 32.

		bool WiFi.ProtectedManagementFrameRequired [readonly]

			(WiFi only) This property indicates whether an AP for
			this service has been seen that requires 802.11w
			(Protected Management Frame) support.

		dict WiFi.VendorInformation [readonly]

			(WiFi only) Information about the vendor of the
			AP, gleaned from WPS and vendor-specific information
			elements in the beacon and probe respondss.

			string Manufacturer [readonly]
				Device manufacturer name as supplied by WPS IE.
			string ModelName [readonly]
				Device model name as supplied by WPS IE.
			string ModelNumber [readonly]
				Device model number as supplied by WPS IE.
			string DeviceName [readonly]
				Device name as supplied by WPS IE.
			string OUIList [readonly]
				Space separated list of OUI identifiers for
				vendor-specific IEs that were neither the
				Microsoft nor Epigram identifiers (the former
				two are used for platform-neutral information).

		uint16 WiFi.RoamThreshold [readwrite]

			(WiFi only) The roam threshold is the AP
			signal-to-noise value (in dB) below which
			wpa_supplicant will attempt to roam to a new AP.
			This per-service RoamThreshold property overrides
			the WiFi device-wide RoamThreshold set through the
			device DBus API. Changes to this property will only
			take effect on the next time the WiFi device connects
			to this service.
