Background
==========

Profiles are containers for persistent storage of instantiated objects.
When an object is created in memory we check if state from any previous
instance was recorded and, if so, update the in-memory data structure
accordingly.  Doing this depends on all object instances having a unique
name; this is done using adhoc techniques based on object proprties such
as WiFi SSID's, device addresses, and security settings.

Multiple profiles may be active simultaneously.  Profiles are organized
in a stack with the top-most entry termed the "active profile".

When the connection manager starts up it pushes a "global profile" onto
the profile stack.  Typically a per-user profile is then pushed at login
and pop'd on logout.  Additional entries may be pushed and pop'd; e.g.
automated tests push a "throw away profile" to capture state generated
by tests and then pop the profile at the end to return the system to a
pristine state.


Object Handling
===============
Service objects go to the "ephemeral profile" by default, and do
not report a "Profile" property.  When saved, by default they end
up in the top-most profile on the stack.

If the "Profile" property is set on a servie, it will be re-parented
to the named profile (which must be in the profile stack at the time).

Device and IPConfig objects go in the global profile (if any).
This ensures that enable/disable state is maintained between users
(and reboots); or possibly discarded (e.g. for testing).

Likewise global state like Offline mode and any Country code are stored
in the global profile (see above).


Profile hierarchy
=================

Service		org.chromium.flimflam
Interface	org.chromium.flimflam.Profile
Object path	[variable prefix]/{profile0,profile1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Return properties for the profile object. See
			the properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Change the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as read-write are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			is emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.InvalidProperty

		dict GetEntry(object path)

			Return properties for the specified profile
			entry.  If the service is currently loaded into
			memory or visible, the returned result will be
			as if a "GetProperties" were called on the service.
			Otherwise, a much more compact dict will be
			returned:

			string Name [readonly]
				Name of this profile.

			string GUID [readonly]
				Globally Unique IDentifier for the service as
				previously set by the client.

			string Error [readonly]
				Last error that occured with this service.

			string Mode [readonly]
				For WiFi services, the operating mode.

			string Security [readonly]
				For WiFi services, the security type.

			string Type [readonly]
				Type of this service entry (wifi, vpn, etc).

			string UIData [readonly]
				The UI data string (ignored by shill) that is
				maintained for each service and can be used by
				client code to store metadata.

			string WiFi.HiddenSSID [readonly]
				For WiFi services, whether or not the
				network broadcasts it's SSID in beacon
				frames.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.NotFound
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments

		dict DeleteEntry(string entry_name)

			Remove the entry from the profile.  Any associated
			service has its security credentials revoked and
			the service is disconnected.  The service is also
			disassociated with the profile.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.NotFound

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string CheckPortalList [readonly]

			The list of technologies for which captive portal
			checking is enabled. This is a comma-separated
			string; e.g. "wifi,wimax,vpn". To alter this
			setting set the Manager.CheckPortalList property.

			This setting is recorded only in the
			default profile as it affects all users and is
			used pre-login.

		string Country [readonly]

			The current ISO country code for WiFi operation.
			This property exists only if the country code
			was set via the Manager.Country property.

			This setting is recorded only in the
			default profile as it affects all users and is
			used pre-login.

		array{object} Entries [readonly]

			List of profile Entry objects.  Use the GetEntry
			method to retrieve an Entry's contents.

		string Name [readonly]

			Name of this profile.

		boolean OfflineMode [readonly]

			The setting for switching all radios on or
			off. This setting is recorded only in the
			default profile as it affects all users and is
			used pre-login.  To alter this setting set the
			Manager.OfflineMode property.

		string PortalURL [readonly]

			The URL to use when doing captive portal
			checking.  To alter this setting set the
			Manager.CheckPortalList property.

			This setting is recorded only in the default
			profile as it affects all users and is used
			pre-login.

		string PortalCheckInterval [readonly]

			The interval in seconds between attempts to
			check for portal.  To alter this setting set the
			Manager.PortalCheckInterval property.

			This setting is recorded only in the default
			profile as it affects all users and is used
			pre-login.

		array{object} Services [readonly]

			List of service objects.  This property is
			provided only for the active profile.

		string UserHash [readonly]

			The hash of the username, provided by the
			the libchromeos SanitizeUsername() method.
